						<td><strong>Bettas</strong></td>
						<td>The Betta or Siamese Fighting Fish is one of the most popular aquarium fish. 
							Over 100 years ago aquarists in the Orient began breeding Betta fish to emphasize 
							color and finnage. The results of those efforts are readily seen in the beautiful 
							variety of today's Bettas.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Discus</strong></td>
						<td>Discus originate in the mixed tropical waters of the Brazilian Amazon River of South America. 
							The Amazon and its tributaries contain water described as either white, clear or black. It is in 
							the areas where these waters "mix" that Discus are found. Today, the Discus is a favorite among 
							experienced freshwater aquarists and does very well in planted aquariums.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Loaches</strong></td>
						<td>Loaches are active bottom dwelling scavengers ideally suited for the community aquarium. 
							Loach fish consist of some of the most popular of all tropical fish, adding color, interest, 
							and beauty to any larger community aquarium. Loaches are semi-aggressive fish when housed in 
							the aquarium individually, so it is important to maintain each species in groups of six or more 
							to minimize aggression.</td>	
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Rainbowfish</strong></td>
						<td>The name Rainbowfish is derived from the amazing iridescent colorations that change 
							when light reflects off of these fish. These hardy, active fish do well with a variety 
							of community fish. A schooling fish, Rainbowfish prefer to be in groups of six or more 
							fish of the same species.</td>	
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Mollies</strong></td>
						<td>Mollies are very versatile fish having the unique ability to live in both freshwater and saltwater 
							if acclimated slowly. Just like other livebearers, mollies are easy to breed, and make fascinating 
							fish for the seasoned aquarist. These fish will add drama and contrast to the semi-aggressive aquarium.</td>
